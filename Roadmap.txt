ðŸ“… Realistic Roadmap (~3â€“5 weeks)
ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning (~2 days)

Goals:

Define scope clearly

Set up repo and basic structure

Tasks:

 Initialize GitHub repo with README

 Create folders: backend/, frontend/, vector_index/, data/

 Decide on frontend (Streamlit = faster, React = better polish)

 Install initial tools:

Python: sentence-transformers, FastAPI, Uvicorn

C++: pybind11, CMake

Optional: Docker

Deliverable:

Empty but structured project folder

Clear roadmap saved in README.md

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Embedding & Backend API (Python) (~4â€“6 days)

Goals:

Enable embedding of text queries & documents

Expose an API to serve embeddings and accept search requests

Tasks:

 Load or create a sample text dataset (100â€“200 short docs)

 Generate and save document embeddings using:

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')


 Save embeddings to .npy and metadata to .json or SQLite

 Create FastAPI endpoints:

POST /search (takes text query)

GET /docs/{id} (fetch doc details)

Deliverable:

Working FastAPI backend that embeds a query and returns dummy search results

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: C++ Vector Similarity Engine (~1 week)

Goals:

Write and bind C++ cosine similarity search to Python

Connect it to the Python API

Tasks:

 Write C++ cosine similarity + top-K search

 Expose to Python with pybind11

 Use CMake to build the shared library (.so or .pyd)

 Test search accuracy vs. sklearn or numpy results

 Plug it into the FastAPI backend:

import vector_index
top_ids = vector_index.top_k_similar(query_vec, all_vectors, k=5)


Deliverable:

Python-C++ pipeline: Query â†’ Embedding â†’ C++ search â†’ Top N results

ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Build the UI (~5â€“7 days)

Option A: Streamlit (easy MVP)
Option B: React (cleaner UX, more effort)

Goals:

User can enter a query

Display top matched documents with scores/snippets

Tasks:

 Build input box for text queries

 Call FastAPI /search endpoint

 Display ranked results

 Show metadata (e.g., title, snippet)

Deliverable:

Usable UI connected to backend, displaying real search results

ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: Polish, Test, and Ship (~5 days)

Goals:

Make it look professional

Package for GitHub and deployment

Tasks:

 Add error handling and logs

 Format output (e.g., confidence scores, titles)

 Add usage instructions in README.md

 Record a 2â€“3 minute demo video (Loom or OBS)

 Optional: Deploy (e.g., on Render, Railway, or localhost)

Deliverable:

Polished, portfolio-ready AI search engine

GitHub repo with live preview or demo video
